Over the years, police brutality has always been a very <span class = "bold_text">big issue</span> and this was one of the reasons why 
                    the movement <span class = "bold_text">Big Lives Matter</span> was formed in 2013(Statista Research Department, 2021). One of the <span class = "bold_text">most controversial</span> police fatalities incident was when an
                    African-American man, George Floyd, was <span class = "bold_text"><span class = "blood_red">murdered</span></span> by a police as the police <span class = "bold_text">knelt on Floyd's neck</span> for over nine minutes while he was handcuffed(Wikipedia, n.d.).

                    <p>In this combo map, we are able to visualize the number of <span class = "bold_text"><span class = "police_text">police</span> <span class = "fatalities_text">fatalities</span> in the states of US per 1 million population</span> along with the <span class = "bold_text">population of each state</span>. We can clearly
                        see that the state that has the darkest colour, which is <span class = "bold_text">Wyoming</span>, has the <span class = "bold_text">highest number of police fatalities per 1 million population</span>. It is also noticeable that some states
                        <span class = "bold_text">do not have a circle plotted in it</span> despite the state being very huge, <span class = "bold_text">Alaska</span> is one of the best examples. Despite <span class = "bold_text">California</span> being the state with the <span class = "bold_text">largest population</span>, it also 
                        does not have the highest number of police fatalities per 1 million population.

                        First of all, just by observing the colour of the heatmap, we can see that overall the colour of the grids from January to August have generally more
                        <span class = "bold_text">darker</span> color grid boxes. However starting from September to December, the overall color of the grid boxes are becoming <span class = "bold_text">lighter</span>. Upon having this
                        observation, we can also see the bar chart on the right which shows the sum of number of police fatalities of each month and the number of police fatalities 
                        are <span class = "bold_text">indeed declining starting from September</span>. Although the reason may not be clear on why this would happen, it may be due to <span class = "bold_text">seasonal pattern during that time, which is Autumn</span>.
