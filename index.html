Over the years, police brutality has always been a very <span class = "bold_text">big issue</span> and this was one of the reasons why 
                    the movement <span class = "bold_text">Big Lives Matter</span> was formed in 2013(Statista Research Department, 2021). One of the <span class = "bold_text">most controversial</span> police fatalities incident was when an
                    African-American man, George Floyd, was <span class = "bold_text"><span class = "blood_red">murdered</span></span> by a police as the police <span class = "bold_text">knelt on Floyd's neck</span> for over nine minutes while he was handcuffed(Wikipedia, n.d.).

                    <p>In this combo map, we are able to visualize the number of <span class = "bold_text"><span class = "police_text">police</span> <span class = "fatalities_text">fatalities</span> in the states of US per 1 million population</span> along with the <span class = "bold_text">population of each state</span>. The state that has the darkest colour, which is <span class = "big_text" id = "wyoming"><span class = "bold_text">Wyoming</span></span>, has the <span class = "big_text"><span class = "bold_text">highest number of <span class ="police_text">police</span> <span class ="fatalities_text">fatalities</span> per 1 million population of 795</span></span>. Some states
                        <span class = "bold_text">have really small circles plotted in it</span> despite the state being very huge, <span class = "bold_text">Alaska</span> is one of the best examples. Despite <span class = "bold_text">California</span> being the state with the <span class = "bold_text">largest population</span>, it 
                        does not have the highest number of police fatalities per 1 million population. This shows that large population doesn't necessarily mean high police fatality rate.
